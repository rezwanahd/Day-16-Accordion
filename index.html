                        the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall
                        appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this
                        with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any
                        HTML can go within the .accordion-body, though the transition does limit overflow. </p>
